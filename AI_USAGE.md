# Use of AI in the Energy Analysis Project

Artificial Intelligence (AI) played a pivotal role in the development, debugging, and optimization of my energy analysis project, which focuses on analyzing weather and energy consumption data across multiple U.S. cities to identify patterns and correlations. By leveraging an advanced AI assistant, I was able to streamline the development process, resolve complex technical issues, and enhance the functionality of the project’s data pipeline and interactive dashboard. Below is a detailed account of how AI was utilized throughout the project.

## 1. Code Development and Implementation
The project required building a sophisticated data pipeline (`pipeline.py`, `data_fetcher.py`, `data_processor.py`) and an interactive Streamlit dashboard (`visualization.py`, `analysis.py`) to fetch, process, and visualize weather and energy data. AI assisted in generating and refining the initial code structure for these components. Specifically:
- **Code Generation**: AI provided well-structured Python scripts tailored to the project’s requirements, including integration with external APIs (NOAA for weather data and EIA for energy data), data processing with pandas, and visualization with Plotly. For example, AI generated the `create_time_series` method in `visualization.py` to produce a dual-axis line chart displaying temperature (solid line) and energy consumption (dotted line) with a city selection dropdown and weekend shading.
- **Customization**: AI incorporated specific requirements, such as coloring the geographic map with red for high energy consumption and green for low consumption based on percentile thresholds, ensuring alignment with project goals.
- **Dynamic Functionality**: AI ensured the pipeline supported a dynamic number of days for data fetching (e.g., up to 90 days by default, adjustable to 270 days), making the system flexible and reusable.

This assistance accelerated the development process by providing accurate, production-ready code that adhered to best practices, such as modular design, error handling, and logging with Loguru.

## 2. Debugging and Error Resolution
The project encountered several technical challenges, including errors in data processing and visualization. AI was instrumental in diagnosing and resolving these issues by analyzing error logs and proposing targeted fixes. Key examples include:
- **TypeError in Data Processing**: An error (`TypeError: unhashable type: 'slice'`) occurred in `data_processor.py` during NOAA weather data processing. AI analyzed the traceback, identified the issue in the `process_noaa_data` method (line 42), and suggested replacing problematic DataFrame indexing (`group[group['datatype'] == 'TMIN']['value']`) with a safer `query` method (`group.query("datatype == 'TMIN'")['value']`). This fix ensured robust handling of weather data and prevented the pipeline from crashing.
- **Threshold Calculation Issues**: Warnings in `analysis.py` indicated insufficient energy data for threshold calculations, causing the time series plot to lack high/low classifications. AI proposed relaxing the data requirement in `calculate_energy_thresholds` (from requiring at least 2 records to 1) and adding global threshold fallbacks to ensure the dashboard displayed meaningful visualizations even with limited data.
- **Log Analysis**: AI interpreted logs (e.g., from July 24, 2025) to pinpoint issues like missing `energy_demand` values for cities like New York, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix, and Seattle. It suggested adding debug logging in `process_eia_data` to inspect raw EIA data, helping identify whether the issue stemmed from API responses or data merging.

These interventions saved significant debugging time and ensured the pipeline and dashboard functioned reliably.

## 3. Visualization Enhancements
The AI assistant helped refine the interactive dashboard to meet specific visualization requirements:
- **Time Series Plot**: AI ensured the time series plot displayed temperature as a solid blue line on the left axis and energy consumption as a dotted red line with color-coded markers (red for high, green for low, yellow for neutral) on the right axis. It also implemented weekend shading, proper axis labels, and a city selection dropdown, aligning with the project’s specifications.
- **Geographic Map**: AI modified the `create_geographic_map` method to use red for high energy consumption and green for low, based on thresholds calculated in `analysis.py`. It added a color legend and hover text to enhance interpretability.
- **Robustness**: AI added fallback mechanisms (e.g., defaulting to yellow/grey markers when thresholds were unavailable) to ensure the dashboard remained functional even with incomplete data.

These enhancements made the dashboard user-friendly and visually intuitive, enabling stakeholders to explore energy consumption patterns effectively.

## 4. Iterative Refinement and Optimization
AI supported an iterative development process by incorporating feedback and refining the codebase. For example:
- After initial pipeline runs, I provided logs showing warnings about insufficient energy data. AI analyzed these and updated `analysis.py` to handle single-record cases and provide global thresholds, ensuring the time series and map visualizations worked as expected.
- AI maintained consistency across updates by reusing artifact IDs for modified files (e.g., `analysis.py`, `visualization.py`) and generating new IDs for new artifacts, adhering to project versioning requirements.
- AI suggested additional features, such as toggles for showing/hiding threshold lines and including threshold values in hover text, which could be implemented to further enhance the dashboard.

## 5. Learning and Skill Development
Beyond technical contributions, AI served as an educational tool. By explaining the purpose of each code change, suggesting best practices (e.g., avoiding nested loops, using pandas efficiently), and providing detailed troubleshooting steps, **AI helped me deepen my understanding of Python, pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit. This knowledge transfer was critical for maintaining and extending the project independently.**

## Conclusion
AI was integral to every phase of the energy analysis project, from code generation and debugging to visualization design and iterative refinement. By providing accurate, context-aware solutions, AI reduced development time, resolved critical errors, and ensured the dashboard met all specified requirements, including dynamic data processing, threshold-based visualizations, and user-friendly interfaces. This collaboration not only delivered a functional project but also enhanced my technical skills, demonstrating the power of AI as both a development tool and a learning resource.
